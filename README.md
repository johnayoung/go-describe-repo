## Project Description: go-describe-repo

### Overview
The `go-describe-repo` project is a tool developed in Go (Golang) designed to generate detailed descriptions of the structure and components of a given repository. Utilizing the OpenAI API, the project takes a directory path as input, analyzes the files within the directory, and synthesizes a description based on the interactions of these files, aiming to assist in understanding the purpose and structure of the project.

### Repository Structure and Components:
1. **.gitignore**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This includes build artifacts, temporary files, and other non-essential files.
   - **Role**: This file keeps the repository clean by ensuring only necessary files are committed, which prevents unnecessary clutter from build artifacts and temporary files.

2. **main.go**
   - **Purpose**: The main entry point for the Go application. It initializes the project, processes the repository’s files, and interacts with the OpenAI API to generate project descriptions.
   - **Role**: It coordinates the overall process of loading environment variables, reading the file structure, generating prompts, calling the OpenAI API, and handling the output.

### Detailed Workflow and Interaction of Components
1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The application begins by loading environment variables using the `godotenv` package. This includes the OpenAI API key necessary for making requests to the OpenAI platform.
   - The user must provide a directory path that contains the repository to be analyzed. This path is processed to deduce the project name and set up an output directory structure.

2. **Reading and Ignoring Files**:
   - The `readGitignore` function reads the `.gitignore` file located in the provided directory. The file's patterns are compiled into a `gitignore` object, which is used to filter out files and directories during the repository analysis.
   - The `filepath.Walk` function traverses the directory, collecting files and filtering out those that match the patterns specified in `.gitignore`.

3. **Language Identification and Entry Point Detection**:
   - The file extensions are tallied to determine the primary language of the repository. The most frequent extension is designated as the primary language.
   - Based on the primary language, the entry point is inferred (e.g., `main.go` for Go projects).

4. **Generating Prompts and Calling OpenAI**:
   - A prompt string is formulated, encapsulating the primary language, file structure, and entry point. This prompt is used to query the OpenAI API for an initial project description.
   - The response from the OpenAI API, which contains a detailed description of the project’s purpose and structure, is then processed.

5. **Creating Project Context and Output**:
   - A `ProjectContext` struct is created, encapsulating the project name, the description generated by OpenAI, the file structure, and the contents of the current code files.
   - This struct is serialized into a JSON file (`project_context.json`) and saved to the output directory.
   - A new prompt is generated to create a detailed project description based on the JSON data, which is then sent to the OpenAI API for further refinement.

6. **Final Project Description**:
   - The detailed project description obtained from the OpenAI API is written to a Markdown file (`project_description.md`), providing a comprehensive overview of the project's components and their interactions.

### Example Usage Workflow
1. **User Modifies Repo Configuration**: The developer ensures the `.gitignore` file is accurate and up-to-date.
2. **Invoke the Tool**: The developer runs the tool by executing `go run main.go /path/to/repository`, initiating the analysis process.
3. **Generate Initial Description**: The tool processes the repository, generates an initial prompt, and queries the OpenAI API for a preliminary project description.
4. **Refine and Save Descriptions**: The detailed project descriptions (in JSON and Markdown format) are saved to the designated output directory, providing valuable documentation for the repository.

In summary, the `go-describe-repo` project uses Go to automate the creation of detailed project documentation by analyzing repository structures and leveraging AI to generate insightful descriptions.
